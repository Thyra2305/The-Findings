<h1><strong> The Findings </strong></h1> 
        

<p1> 

Laws and stories are usually seen as separate entities, one rather boring and the other fantastical. 
You might not expect the two to meet at any point, but that is precisely what happened in the three stories. 
The findings are really fascinating as fiction merged with reality in order to entertain. However, this isn’t really a new phenomenon. 
From Shakespeare to Netflix, reality has inspired our favourite works for centuries, and it appears that the Celtic bards and later scribes followed this same trend. 

  </p1>

<p2> In Tormac Étaine, the contract drawn up between the Dagda (the king of the gods in the Irish pantheon) and Elcmar (a lesser deity) is about land for Óengus (the god of love). 
The law is used but with some very creative leeway. Elcmar doesn’t realise, at any point, that the Dagda was both the king and judge. 
Thus, it makes the contract a poisoned chalice. 

  </p2> 
 
<p3> The painful legal ignorance of the characters doesn’t stop here. Later on, a minor god named Midir tries to get his ex-wife Étaine back from her current husband. 
Midir’s claims to have the right to get Étaine back, because he won a stake from a game of fidchell, often claimed to be the ancestor of chess. Here, there is something important to note: 
stakes from a game of fidchell were not a legal method of making contracts. 
The whole contract was void before it was even made! The only reason Midir got his wife back in the end was simply because her current husband let her go.

<p4> If you believe that these are the only two cases of a comedic use of the law, you are quite mistaken. 
In Táin Bó Froích, another story, Medb and Ailill, the king and queen of Connacht, try to get Froích 
(a suitor of their daughter’s with fairy heritage) to agree to an extortionate marriage contract. Froích, not being an idiot, doesn’t agree to it, which makes
Medb and Ailill afraid he would elope with their daughter. 
Fearing retribution from other suitors, they try to get rid of Froích using a water monster living in their pond. 
If their murder attempt had been successful, they would have had to pay fines. Not only for the killing. The deal breaker was the fact they knew of the water monster
living in their pond!

<p5> The Welsh also used the law to entertain. Or to shock in this case. In Branwen, uerch Lyr, Bendigeidfran, the king of the British Isles, and Manawydan, his brother,
asked their sister Branwen to marry the King of Ireland, Matholwch, to secure their political alliance. 
The problem child of the family, Efnysien, Branwen’s half-brother, did not agree to this. So what does he do? He mutilates Matholwch’s horses. 
Efnysien's consent was not legally necessary, which makes the mutilation of the the horses all the more worse. 
This illegal act was supposed to be the pretext for the rest of the events that happened throughout the story.

  </p5>

<p6> Much like Harry Potter or Shakespeare’s Macbeth, real life concerns and attributes are used in all three Celtic stories to entertain an audience. 
  Even if that audience did have some peculair stories that they found entertaining. </p6>
